### Practice with Python
This repository contains several small projects and experiments working with Python. 
The goal is to explore and use several vital libraries within the Python ecosystem, and familiarize myself with them through projects I enjoy working on.
Ideally, projects here will reach a point where they can earn their own repository to be worked on further. READMEs in project folders will contain any relevant information as to the status of the project.

Any system calls are designed to use a POSIX system; so they may not work properly on Windows.

##### Currently using:
- Django
- Tkinkter
- Flask
- Pygame
